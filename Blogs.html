                            In business, nothing stays the same. Regulations change, new security threats appear overnight, and data continues to expand at an exponential pace. Today there are over 147 zettabytes of data in the entire digital universe, up from 64.2 zettabytes in 2020.* This trend of explosive data growth is expected to become even more pronounced moving forward.

Your data supports decision-making, drives innovation, and allows you to out-beat your competition. If you’re simply keeping up, you’re already falling behind. The only way to survive this relentless surge of data and environment of constant change is to implement strategies that protect your data and prepare it for unpredictable yet inevitable shifts."

                data-description="Data Center Resilience
                            Your data center is the central nervous system of your enterprise, orchestrating the flow of information that powers everything from everyday communications to complex computational processes. At a time when the demand for uninterrupted digital services continues to escalate, maintaining a resilient data center is not a luxury—it’s a necessity. According to recent research, the average cost of downtime for large organizations hovers around $9,000 per minute. In high-stakes sectors like finance and healthcare, the financial impact can reach millions per hour, not to mention the additional costs from fines or penalties.*
                            
                            A robust data center is not just about preventing downtime; it’s about ensuring the entire IT infrastructure can anticipate, withstand, and react to various types of disruptions, whether from a natural disaster, a cyberattack, or a simple hardware failure—without losing functionality. The foundation of such resilience is an advanced network architecture that supports and reinforces all layers of data center operations."

                            Today, networks are no longer centralized in an office or data center; they now span across offices, remote locations, and cloud environments. Keeping these diverse network elements running smoothly requires constant monitoring, quick configuration changes, and rapid responses to network incidents—tasks that traditional network models struggle to manage efficiently.

                            Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) has emerged as a game-changer in this space, offering flexibility, scalability, and a streamlined approach to network management. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in recent years has radically enhanced these capabilities, automating complex processes and infusing intelligence into network management like never before."
